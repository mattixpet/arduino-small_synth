# arduino-small_synth

## Usage:
* You could try to recreate the physical synth itself, you would have to go through the code and look at pin numbers and recreate the voltage values for the control. But the code is here.

## Info:
###### I made a small single octave synth using nothing but arduino and a simple high/low output of the arduino to create a square wave sound at note frequencies. It even had an arpeggiator (surprisingly simple to program) with a tempo changer (variable resistor), and 2 more octaves (1 below and 1 above).

* Look at a demo video of the full fletched synth, **demo.mov**
